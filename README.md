# 60-Minute Frontend Challenge: Single-Page CV

## Project Overview
This project is a timed "speed-build" completed in under 60 minutes. The objective was to translate a professional design into a functional web page using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

This project is part of the [Roadmap.sh Single-Page CV project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv).

### The Challenge
* **Time Limit:** 60 Minutes
* **Focus:** Fundamental structure, CSS styling, and visual accuracy.
* **Constraints:** No JavaScript or external frameworks used.

## Visual Reference
I utilized a side-by-side workflow to ensure the build matched the requirements as closely as possible within the hour timeframe.

## Tech Stack & Styling
* **HTML5:** Semantic list structures and basic document flow.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling using an **Arial** font-stack and a **Royal Blue/Green** color palette.

## Project Context
I am currently a 3rd-year **BSc Information Technology student at Eduvos**, specializing in **Data Science**. While this project focuses on Frontend development, it helps bridge the gap between building user interfaces and presenting data-driven research professionally.

## Lessons Learned & Future Audit
Taking this from a "quick build" to a professional standard, I've identified several key areas for improvement that I will apply to my upcoming projects (such as my **Dementia Risk Prediction** and **K-Means Clustering** work):

1. **Semantic HTML:** Moving beyond generic `<div>` tags to use landmark elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<header>` for better accessibility.
2. **SEO & Metadata:** Implementing `<meta>` description and `viewport` tags to ensure the site is searchable and mobile-responsive.
3. **Open Graph Tags:** Adding OG tags to control how the project appears when shared on social platforms.
4. **Favicon:** Including a custom browser tab icon for a complete professional finish.
