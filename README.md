# 60-Minute Challenge: Single-Page CV Build

## Project Overview
This project is a fast-paced "speed build" completed in under an hour. The objective was to translate a design requirement into a functional webpage using core web technologies while maintaining visual accuracy.

This build is part of the [Roadmap.sh Single-Page CV project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv).

### The Goal
* **Duration:** < 60 Minutes
* **Objective:** Achieve visual accuracy using clean code structure.
* **Constraints:** Pure HTML and CSS only.

## Visual Comparison
Below is the side-by-side comparison of the design requirements versus my final build.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structuring content with headings and lists.
* **CSS3:** Styling with a focus on typography (**Arial** font-stack) and layout precision.

## Context & Background
I am a third-year **BSc Information Technology student at Eduvos**, specializing in **Data Science**. While my primary focus is on research and data-driven models—such as my previous work in **Dementia Risk Prediction** (utilizing preprocessing and feature selection) and **Customer Segmentation** using **K-Means clustering**—this project helps me build the frontend skills necessary to present research insights effectively.

## Lessons Learned & Future Audit
Through this timed challenge, I identified several technical areas to implement in future projects to move from a student level to a professional standard:

### HTML & SEO
* **Semantic HTML:** Moving beyond `<div>` tags to use landmark elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<header>` for accessibility.
* **SEO & Metadata:** Implementing `<meta>` descriptions and the `viewport` tag to ensure the site is searchable and mobile-responsive.
* **Open Graph (OG) Tags:** Learning how to control how links appear when shared on professional platforms.
* **Favicons:** Adding custom browser tab icons for a finished, professional feel.

### CSS & Styling
* **Separation of Concerns:** Moving all inline styles (such as list-bullet types) into the external CSS sheet for cleaner code.
* **Container-Based Layouts:** Replacing global HTML padding with a centered container to improve visual balance across different screen sizes.
* **Descriptive Naming:** Adopting professional naming conventions for classes (e.g., using `.section-heading` instead of `.small`) to improve code readability.
